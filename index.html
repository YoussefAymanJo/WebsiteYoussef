            <h2>Understanding the Brain</h2>
            <p>The human brain is the most complex organ in the body, responsible for thought, memory, emotion, and coordination. It consists of billions of neurons that communicate through electrical and chemical signals. The brain is divided into different regions, each controlling specific functions, such as movement, speech, and sensory perception.</p>
            <p>It is composed of three main parts: the cerebrum, which handles cognitive functions; the cerebellum, responsible for balance and coordination; and the brainstem, which controls vital involuntary processes like breathing and heart rate.</p>
